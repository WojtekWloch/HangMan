# HangMan
Few months ago I have asked myself what is next step in my professional career, what do I really like in my current job and what I would like to change. The best thing about graphic is that I create things from the scratch and can observe fina≈Ç product. The biggest challanges are sometimes lack of logic thinking and lack of possibility to improve processes in company. I found that coding gives me remediation for my current challanges, as there is no coding without logic thinking, in addition I can keep crearion piece which gives me a lot of fun today. It was logic decision to kick off a bit of fun in coding.
